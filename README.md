Code for Covid-19 Spatial Analysis

To run the R Shiny app, the following files need to be copied into a folder (do not include any other files and do not rename any of these files):
app.R
colnames_for_app.csv
tester3.dbf
tester3.prj
tester3.shp
tester3.shx

You may need to install some packages i.e. Shiny, for it to run.

To run the app this way, simply open the app.R file and click 'Run app' and the app should open in a new window.
